            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Glenn Burgess, a backend developer currently living in Utah. After years of connecting people to solutions, I decided it was time to become the one crafting those solutions myself. Although I'm still relatively new to the field, my passion lies in Python, where I excel at problem-solving and turning ideas into reality.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, I'm working on this very webpage—my first foray into front-end development! It's been a journey of trial and error, a lot of Google-fu, and sheer determination to bring my vision to life.</p>
    
            <p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me embracing my hobbies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dungeons & Dragons</strong>: I love the limitless possibilities of problem-solving and creativity.</li>
                <li><strong>Disc Golf</strong>: I enjoy practicing and anticipating challenges before they arise, as well as learning how to recover quickly when things don’t go as planned.</li>
                <li><strong>3D Printing</strong>: There’s something magical about transforming an idea into a tangible creation through patience and hard work.</li>
                <li><strong>Board Games</strong>: From Food Chain Magnate to Ark Nova, I thrive on learning new strategies and rules to turn the tables in my favor.</li>
                <li><strong>Boating</strong>: Nothing beats the joy of gliding across the water, soaking up the sun, and embracing the freedom it brings.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>I also enjoy video games, especially heavily modded Minecraft and cooperative games I can play with my wife, Jessica. Our adventures together have taken us around the world, making her my best friend and partner in crime.</p>
    
            <p>My favorite anime characters inspire my approach to life: Luffy teaches me to never give up on my dreams, Goku reminds me to always strive for improvement, and Naruto shows me the power of teamwork in creating a better world. The Marvel Cinematic Universe drives home the idea that anyone can be a hero; it's all about the choices we make.</p>
    
            <p>As I continue to learn and grow in my backend development journey, I aim to one day become a senior developer who can coach newcomers. I’ve already attended tech meetups and joined a Discord server filled with developers working on a D&D product, eager to connect and collaborate.</p>
    
            <p>I’m hands-on in my learning—much like this website! I dive in headfirst, using resources and my determination to tackle each challenge. My guiding principle is simple: "Life is better when you are laughing."</p>

        <h2>Professional Background</h2>
        <p>After years of connecting people to solutions, I’m excited to create solutions myself. I have a background in sales and management, where I honed my problem-solving skills and adaptability. Transitioning into backend development has been an exciting journey!</p>
        <p>I recently served as a Data Annotation Specialist at Tesla, recognized as "Data Labeler of the Week" for my commitment to quality and efficiency. Before that, I spent a decade with Vector Marketing, where I earned the "Annual Incentive Trip" three times and ranked as a top 10 branch manager. I had the privilege of helping run the #1 new business office in the nation in the fall of 2017.</p>
        <p>In addition to my sales experience, I've developed a range of technical skills. I'm most confident in Python and Git, and I've worked on projects including a Pokédex game using the PokeAPI and an Asteroids game with Python and Pygame. I also built a system for analyzing large datasets during my time earning a Python Fundamentals certificate from Cornell, and I created a Spell Scraper using JavaScript to parse HTML into usable JSON.</p>
        <p>With 13 certificates from Boot.dev and a Python certificate from Cornell, I'm eager to explore data management, AI, and machine learning. My goal is to become a Senior Developer, mentoring new developers along the way. I pride myself on clear communication, hard work, and problem-solving abilities, always striving for improvement!</p>
